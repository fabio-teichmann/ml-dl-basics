# OOP is a tool to break up a real-world scenario into separate object.
# These objects can be given functionalities (methods) to achieve whatever
# that class of objects need to fulfill.

# Naming convention: class keyword + CamelToeNaming
class BigObject:
    pass


# instantiate: create a new instance of class BigObject
bo = BigObject()
print(type(bo))
